# crux101

My playground for evaluating/torturing juxt's crux

My setup is a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4810MQ CPU @ 2.80GHz, with commodity SSD.

I'm using postgres for the document store, and rocks-db for the backend, all on the same box

## Usage

Single core.clj file with some testing

'stuff-it will load 50K records into the store, which is used to play later

there are a few tests - most of these are trying to tease out when crux is
using the indexes, by "feel"
